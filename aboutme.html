<h1>HELLO ! WELCOME TO MY PORTFOLIO</h1>

<hr></hr>

<br></br>

      <body>

I am an incoming student at The University of Waterloo studying Systems Design Engineering. During my four years in high school, I spent my time balancing the international baccalaureate program, competitive soccer, various extra-curriculars while also honing my passions for technology, product design and innovation.

From building VR experiences that educate students on the Australian bushfire crisis, to researching big data and APIs to combat the spread of diseases for Nasa SpaceApps, to designing Apple Watches using Fusion360; my passion for innovation and design remained constant.

Currently, I am learning how to use Python Flask and Javascript and using these languages to code some cool projects.

In my free time, you can find me hiking, playing various sports and discovering new restaurants and clothing stores!
